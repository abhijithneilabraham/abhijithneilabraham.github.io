                    <p>I have always believed that the true happiness is in the PURSUIT of ambitions, not when you achieve it. My ambitions are not my job, my free time or the places I visit. I follow a philosophy of life, where I could give my time to you and hopefully you give me back, and in our little time together, let's figure out how to live.</p>
                    <br></br>
                    <p>I care about you if you have a mission of social cause, or for the people around your circle. Communities makes me happy. Everyone is a resource to each other, no matter how small you believe you are. Even if you know/do little about something, the appreciation you give to the ones who does well, matters to them, so that's a fair contribution too, right? Haha</p>

With GiftCardBank platform where they help financially the families in America who had a terrible time and lost their income during Covid, through collecting and redistributing Gift Cards. I created a tool to sort out unrelated customer grievances using AI.

                   Ha, so school kids. I am more proud of them. Cheeky,mischievious and some ambitious. They wanted to play drums with the desk, wanted to know why religions exist when I am teaching science, and wants to believe in magic. I dont know what mature answer I could give to them, so being one of them and asking questions back,or letting them laugh wholeheartedly was my only option. 
                   Oh, and my kids used to give me gifts and I would buy them chocolates and icecreams with my salary. I mark those as some golden moments in life.

                                <p>
                                Well, not winning anything is okay, had a great experience building stuff. Do you need to win in order to succeed? Or do you need to succeed in order to find peace with yourself?
