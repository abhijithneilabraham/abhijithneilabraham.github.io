                <p>
                I contributed to various tools in autonomio for the open source community. Here are the major contributions I did.

            <h4>2020-2022 I worked here. Here's what I did so far.</h4>
            <p>
                ● Worked with the R&D team and built softwares, models
                and wrote research papers for accelerating clinical trials
            </p>
        <p>
               
            <p>
                ● Built pipelines and wrote research papers(currently under review) for Question Summarisation. Question Summarisation is a dataset of clinical FAQs  with summarised versions as targets. Usually the FAQs tend to be too long with unnecessary information in the Question which makes it harder to read quickly. The goal of the model is to predict the most accurate summary of the question.
            </p>
            <p>
                ●  Built pipelines and wrote research papers in Natural Language processing for  <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.louhi-1.10/">Bio-SimCSE</a>. Currently, Sentence Transformers does not have a bio-medical version. Our research explored the baselines for creating such a model.
            </p>
        <p>
                ● Built and deployed to huggingface:  <a href="https://github.com/abhijithneilabraham/covid-qa">Covid Question Answering</a>
            </p>
        <p>
                ● Built an auto-mapping software for cross matching
                medical domain databases.
            </p>
        <p>
                ● Wrote software for a faster alternative to my own product
                TableQA.

                <p>
                Well, that was exciting. It was also the first time I was collaborating with people outside my country. With GiftCardBank platform where they help financially the families in America who had a terrible time and lost their income during Covid, through collecting and redistributing Gift Cards. I created a tool to sort out unrelated customer grievances using AI.

                What an amazing group of humans we got here. We talk daily about technology,often  helps each other learn and conducts events, workshops,hackathons, and always plans new ideas. Also a fun place to share tech memes and have occasional laughs. Haha.
                Building a community is such a great feeling. I do feel proud about all the outcomes the community have brought together.</p>

                <h3>Teaching, tech and non-tech</h3>
                <h4>Well, I have taught ML on behalf of various clubs across, and once on behalf of Google. I also used to take tuitions part time for school kids.</h4>
                <p>
                   Ha, so school kids. I am more proud of them. Cheeky,mischievious and some ambitious. They wanted to play drums with the desk, wanted to know why religions exist when I am teaching science, and wants to believe in magic. I dont know what mature answer I could give to them, so being one of them and asking questions back,or letting them laugh wholeheartedly was my only option. 
                   Oh, and my kids used to give me gifts and I would buy them chocolates and icecreams with my salary. I mark those as some golden moments in life.
                </p>
